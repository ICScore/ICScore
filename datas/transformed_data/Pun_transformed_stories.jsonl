The owner warned him they would be donated if he left them again, saying, \"If you keep this up, you'll have to 'sow' the seeds for a new wardrobe!\" Kyle did not want to 'fabricate' a clothing crisis, so he decided to 'needle' his bad habit and wait for his clothes to finish. Determined not to 'quilt' on his commitment, he 'threaded' the needle of attentiveness and 'stitched' around until his laundry cycle was complete. From then on, Kyle never left any clothes 'stitched' up in the laundromat again."}
